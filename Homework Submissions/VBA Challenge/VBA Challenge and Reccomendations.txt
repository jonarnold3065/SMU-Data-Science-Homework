Summary Notes

AKS was without a doubt the highest performing stock as it had gained 355% during the period the data was drawn from. 

AK Steel is a fully integrated producer of flat rolled carbon, stainless and electrical steels and tubular products through its wholly owned subsidiary AK Steel Coporation.  

While considering investments you should monitor the steel commodities for volatility in the markets.  As with any commodity the price of steel, and subsequently the profit margins of AK Steel, can vary based on supply and demand.   One of the additional factors to monitor is the Auto indsutry and accident frequency.  Higher car sales will lead to higher demand in steel, increased accident frequency would also put pressure on steel demand. (the more accidents, the more replacement parts are needed)   Inversely, advances such as self driving cars and reduced driving would bring down new car/parts sales, and would reduce demand.  

Stocks to avoid: 
ADPT, Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp has experience significant volatility in the stock price.  Consider only for high risk and high reward investment scenarios.  The success of a bio-tech company hinges upon successful rollouts of new products.  A failed product can negatively impact the stock prices within a relatively short amount of time. Consider as a recommendation for younger investors as they can absorb losses on riskier investments.
